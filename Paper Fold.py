A piece of paper cannot be folded into half more than 7 times with bare hands. So to overcome this, the company RelearnPro has desighned a machine to fold the paper as many times you want by generating immesnse force. So given a piece of paper with a thickness 'T' mm, and after folding the paper into half for 'N' times, find what will be size of the paper in mm.

Input Format

Two spaced integers T and N where T is the thickness of the paper in mm and N is the number of times a paper has to be folded into half.

Constraints

1<=T,N<=10^9

Output Format

Print the answer in modulus of 10^9
